# Object-Detection
 Object detection is a computer vision technology that involves identifying the objects and localizing objects of interest within an image or video.
 It is a challenging task as it involves not only recognizing the presence of an object but also detecting its precise location and size within image or video by drawing bounding boxes around them.

The image below showcases the results of the object detection model applied to an input image. The model detects various objects within the scene, drawing bounding boxes around them, labeling each detected object with its category (e.g., person, car, dog, etc.)
