# Object-Detection
 Object detection is a computer vision technology that involves identifying the objects and localizing objects of interest within an image or video.
 It is a challenging task as it involves not only recognizing the presence of an object but also detecting its precise location and size within image or video by drawing bounding boxes around them.
